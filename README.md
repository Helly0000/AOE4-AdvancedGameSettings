### Known Issues

#### AI
Game has currently no dedicated API for AI as an result any issue related to AI behaviour can't be fixed.
I suggest you to provide feedback to Relic, so they can improve AI or provide official API.

#### King Unit
Currently there is issue where King is T-Posing on death. This issue can't be fixed in the mod as this is currently only Game Mode script.
